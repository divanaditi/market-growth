One of the primary types is stereo vision, which uses dual cameras to capture depth information and create 3D images. This technology has seen widespread adoption due to its ability to produce high-quality, realistic 3D visuals for photography and augmented reality applications. In Germany, stereo vision is increasingly being integrated into smartphones for enhanced camera functionalities, such as object recognition and 3D scanning. This trend is being driven by the growing demand for more immersive experiences in gaming, virtual reality, and social media interactions, which require accurate depth sensing and 3D rendering.<p>Another key type of 3D imaging is time-of-flight (ToF) sensing, which has gained momentum in the German smartphone market. ToF sensors use light to measure the time it takes for a signal to bounce back from objects, enabling precise depth mapping. This technology is particularly valued for its accuracy in creating 3D models and enhancing portrait photography, where users can achieve a professional-level bokeh effect.
