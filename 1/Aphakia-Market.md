One of the major segments includes surgical interventions, such as lens implantation procedures, which have been gaining popularity due to their effective outcomes in restoring vision. This segment includes both primary lens implantation, which is performed at the time of cataract surgery, and secondary lens implantation, which is conducted when a patient develops aphakia after cataract removal. Additionally, the market sees demand for refractive lens exchange (RLE) procedures, which are used to treat patients with presbyopia or other refractive errors. With advancements in surgical technology, more patients are opting for customized treatments, boosting the growth of this segment within the German market.<p>Another key segment in the Germany aphakia market is non-surgical options, such as optical aids like aphakic spectacles and contact lenses.
