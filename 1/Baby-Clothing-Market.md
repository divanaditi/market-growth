They are often designed with snap buttons for quick diaper changes, making them a practical option for parents. As parents become more conscious of fabric quality and sustainability, organic cotton and eco-friendly options are gaining popularity within the top segment.

In addition, the growing trend of gender-neutral clothing has led to increased interest in bottoms that cater to both boys and girls.
