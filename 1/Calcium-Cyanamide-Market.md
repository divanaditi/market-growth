Granular calcium cyanamide is widely used due to its easy handling, slow-release properties, and suitability for various agricultural applications. It acts as an efficient nitrogen fertilizer, helping to improve soil quality and enhance crop yield. The granular form is often preferred by farmers for its convenience and controlled nutrient release, which reduces the need for frequent applications. Additionally, it serves as an effective soil conditioner, promoting better root development and overall plant health. The demand for granular calcium cyanamide is expected to rise steadily, driven by increasing agricultural practices and the growing need for efficient fertilizers in Germany's agricultural sector.</p><p>On the other hand, powdered calcium cyanamide is used in industrial applications, such as in the production of steel and other chemicals. It is highly reactive and plays a crucial role in removing impurities during the manufacturing process. Powdered calcium cyanamide also finds applications in the production of lime and as a desulfurizing agent in various industries.
