<h1>Germany Coronary Stents Market Size By Type 2031 </h1><blockquote id="" class=""><strong><a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/47832/?utm_source=Github-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Coronary Stents Market size was valued at USD 8.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 12.3 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.2% from 2024 to 2030.</a></strong></blockquote><p><h2>Germany Coronary Stents Market by Type</h2><p>The Germany coronary stents market is primarily segmented into drug-eluting stents (DES) and bare-metal stents (BMS), with DES holding the dominant market share. Drug-eluting stents have gained widespread adoption due to their ability to prevent restenosis by releasing medication that inhibits scar tissue formation in the artery. These stents are increasingly preferred for complex coronary artery disease treatments, where the risk of restenosis is higher. Additionally, the advancement in DES technology, including biodegradable and bioresorbable materials, has contributed to their popularity, as these stents offer improved long-term outcomes. As a result, DES are considered a first-line treatment for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in Germany, leading to a steady increase in their demand within the market.<p>Bare-metal stents, on the other hand, are expected to maintain a significant share due to their cost-effectiveness and ease of use. Although BMS are less effective in preventing restenosis compared to drug-eluting stents, they are still commonly used in patients with a low risk of restenosis or in cases where long-term medication adherence may be a concern. BMS are also often used in cases where DES is not suitable, such as in patients with an allergy to the drugs used in drug-eluting stents.
