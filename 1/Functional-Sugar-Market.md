<h1>Growth and Future Outlook of the Functional Sugar Market</h1>        <p>The functional sugar market has been witnessing significant growth in recent years, primarily driven by the increasing demand for healthier sugar alternatives and the rising awareness regarding the adverse effects of excessive sugar consumption. This shift in consumer preferences is largely influenced by health trends, as well as government regulations promoting healthier products.
