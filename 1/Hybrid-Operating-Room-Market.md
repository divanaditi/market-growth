Integrated operating rooms are characterized by advanced technological systems that connect various medical devices, imaging equipment, and patient monitoring systems into a cohesive network. These rooms offer greater flexibility, improved workflow, and enhanced precision during surgeries, making them highly preferred for complex and minimally invasive procedures. The integration of real-time imaging and surgical equipment streamlines the process and reduces the likelihood of errors, contributing to better patient outcomes. Hospitals and medical centers are increasingly adopting integrated operating rooms to keep pace with technological advancements and improve surgical efficiency.<p>On the other hand, non-integrated hybrid operating rooms offer a less complex infrastructure but still allow for the use of advanced imaging and surgical tools during operations. These rooms generally combine traditional operating room settings with specialized imaging technology, such as X-rays or MRI machines, to facilitate minimally invasive surgeries. While non-integrated operating rooms may not offer the same level of advanced connectivity as integrated systems, they are often more cost-effective and easier to set up for facilities with limited budgets or space.
