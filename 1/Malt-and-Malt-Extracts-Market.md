The demand for malt in Germany is driven by its integral role in the beer industry, where it contributes to both the flavor and color of the beverage. Additionally, malt is used in various bakery products and as a natural sweetener in food applications. The increasing consumption of malt-based beverages, coupled with the growth in craft beer production, has propelled the demand for malt in Germany, especially among smaller craft breweries and large-scale industrial producers alike.
