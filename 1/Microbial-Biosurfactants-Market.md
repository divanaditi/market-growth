Rhamnolipids are derived from the bacterium *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, and are widely used due to their excellent surface-active properties. They are suitable for applications in the oil and gas industry, cleaning agents, and bioremediation. Sophorolipids, produced by yeast species such as *Starmerella bombicola*, are increasingly being used in personal care and cosmetics due to their mildness and biocompatibility. Sophorolipids also exhibit antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, making them suitable for a wide range of industrial and consumer products. The demand for rhamnolipids and sophorolipids in Germany is driven by increasing environmental awareness and the growing trend toward sustainable and bio-based alternatives to chemical surfactants.</p><p>Another significant category in the microbial biosurfactants market is mannosylerythritol lipids (MEL), produced by certain yeast strains. MEL is particularly favored for its biodegradability and effectiveness in enhancing cleaning performance in both industrial and household products.
