Truck-mounted cranes are the most commonly used due to their versatility and ability to be quickly deployed on construction sites. These cranes combine the mobility of a truck with the lifting capacity of a crane, making them ideal for both urban and rural construction projects. They are typically used in situations where ease of transportation and fast setup are essential. Crawler cranes, on the other hand, offer superior stability and lifting capabilities, making them suitable for heavy-duty tasks and challenging terrains. Their undercarriages with continuous tracks allow them to work on soft or uneven ground without the need for additional setup, making them ideal for industrial and infrastructure projects. <p>All-terrain cranes are a hybrid type that blends the features of both truck-mounted and crawler cranes. These cranes offer enhanced mobility on both paved roads and rough terrains, providing excellent flexibility for a range of applications. The ability to transport equipment between job sites without requiring additional vehicles makes all-terrain cranes particularly popular for large-scale construction and infrastructure projects. These cranes are designed to offer high lifting capacities while maintaining mobility, which makes them ideal for jobs that require both flexibility and strength.
