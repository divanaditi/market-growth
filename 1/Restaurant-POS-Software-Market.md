On-premise POS systems are traditionally installed and maintained within the restaurant's premises, offering a more secure and stable solution for managing transactions, orders, and inventory. These systems are preferred by larger establishments with dedicated IT teams, as they offer customization and control over system performance. However, the need for regular updates, maintenance, and a higher upfront cost can be limiting factors for some businesses. On-premise systems also require physical hardware like servers, which adds to the cost and complexity of the setup. Despite these challenges, the reliability and direct control offered by on-premise solutions continue to make them popular among certain types of restaurants in Germany.</p><p>In contrast, cloud-based POS systems are gaining significant traction in the German market due to their flexibility and cost-effectiveness.
