Fixed magnification riflescopes have a set magnification power, providing simplicity and durability, making them popular among hunters and shooters who prefer ease of use and reliability. These scopes are often chosen for short to medium-range shooting applications, where the magnification requirements do not change frequently. On the other hand, variable magnification scopes offer a wider range of magnification options, allowing users to adjust the zoom level according to shooting conditions and distance. These scopes are highly favored by precision shooters and long-range hunters, offering flexibility and adaptability for diverse shooting scenarios, from close-range targets to distant objects. The choice between these two types often depends on the user's shooting style and the nature of the shooting environment.</p><p>In addition to magnification types, Germany’s riflescope market also witnesses demand for specialized scopes, such as illuminated reticle scopes and thermal scopes.
