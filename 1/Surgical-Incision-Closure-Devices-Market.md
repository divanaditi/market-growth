Manual devices, including sutures, staples, and adhesive strips, are widely used due to their cost-effectiveness and ease of use. These devices are often preferred in less complex surgical procedures where precision and skill are critical. Sutures, for instance, are one of the oldest and most trusted methods of wound closure, offering reliable results in both internal and external tissue repair. Staples, on the other hand, are gaining popularity in surgeries involving high-tension wounds, as they provide faster application and better durability. Adhesive strips are typically used for small, superficial cuts and are gaining traction due to their non-invasive nature and ease of application in outpatient settings.</p><p>Automated devices, including staplers and robotic surgical systems, are rapidly advancing in the surgical incision closure market. These devices provide increased precision and efficiency, minimizing human error during the wound closure process. Surgical staplers, particularly those used in laparoscopic and minimally invasive surgeries, are becoming increasingly popular for their ability to close incisions quickly and securely. Robotic systems, such as those integrated with surgical instruments, are further improving the closure process by enabling more accurate and consistent results. The automation of incision closure reduces patient recovery time and enhances surgical outcomes.
