The demand for entrance mats in Germany is driven by the increasing need for cleanliness and safety in workplaces and public spaces. The mats not only enhance cleanliness but also contribute to improving indoor air quality by trapping dust particles at the entry points of buildings, which is essential for maintaining a hygienic environment.<p>On the other hand, anti-fatigue mats are primarily used to provide comfort and reduce strain for employees who stand for extended periods, especially in industrial and retail settings.
