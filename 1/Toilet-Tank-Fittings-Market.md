Flush valves are essential components that regulate the release of water from the tank into the toilet bowl when the flush is activated. These valves ensure that the appropriate amount of water is released efficiently, contributing to effective waste removal and water conservation. With rising awareness of water-saving technologies, the demand for advanced, low-flow flush valves is growing. Manufacturers are focusing on producing more durable and water-efficient models to meet both consumer needs and regulatory standards.
