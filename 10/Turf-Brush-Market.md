Manual turf brushes are widely used for smaller-scale turf maintenance, offering an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution. These brushes are designed for hands-on cleaning and grooming of artificial turf, ensuring that the surface remains free from debris and maintains a consistent appearance. Their simple construction and ease of use make them popular among homeowners, small sports facilities, and those looking for a low-maintenance option for turf care. In addition, manual turf brushes are ideal for spot cleaning and can be employed for light to moderate turf usage.</p><p>On the other hand, powered turf brushes cater to larger-scale applications, such as sports complexes, commercial establishments, and extensive artificial turf fields.
