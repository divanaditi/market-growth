Fixed-frame screens dominate the market due to their ease of installation and superior viewing experience. These screens are designed to offer a consistent, high-quality image without the need for additional mechanical components, making them ideal for home theaters, business presentations, and education environments. They are often made from durable, high-quality materials that ensure better contrast and color accuracy, appealing to consumers seeking premium performance. Fixed-frame screens are highly popular in residential settings where a permanent, seamless display is desired. Their robust construction and simple design also contribute to their increasing demand in various professional environments where clarity and reliability are essential.<p>Motorized Ultra Short Throw screens, on the other hand, offer the advantage of convenience and versatility. These screens can be automatically deployed or retracted with a simple remote control or integrated system. This feature makes motorized screens especially attractive for consumers who require a clean and minimalist look, as they can be concealed when not in use. The growing trend of smart homes and offices in Germany has also led to an increased demand for motorized screens, as they align with modern design preferences and technological advancements. These screens are ideal for spaces where flexibility is needed, such as conference rooms, classrooms, and multi-purpose entertainment rooms.
