The two primary types include micro-nanobubbles and nano-nanobubbles. Micro-nanobubbles typically range from 100 nanometers to 1 micron in size, offering significant applications in water treatment, agriculture, and industrial processes. These bubbles are known for their ability to enhance oxygenation and improve the efficiency of various chemical and biological processes. The demand for micro-nanobubble generators has grown due to their ability to improve the solubility of gases in liquids, which makes them valuable in wastewater treatment, aquaculture, and food processing sectors. As industries continue to seek sustainable solutions, micro-nanobubbles play a pivotal role in reducing environmental impact and improving operational efficiency.<p>On the other hand, nano-nanobubbles, which are smaller in size, typically ranging between 50 and 200 nanometers, offer advanced properties for precise applications. Nano-nanobubble generators are used in niche markets, including precision agriculture, biotechnology, and medical treatments. These bubbles have unique characteristics, such as a high surface area-to-volume ratio, which leads to enhanced gas dissolution and microbial activity. In the agricultural sector, nano-nanobubbles are being utilized for improving water quality and promoting plant growth through more efficient oxygenation.
