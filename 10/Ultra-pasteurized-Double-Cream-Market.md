The standard variant is the most popular due to its rich texture and high-fat content, making it ideal for culinary applications such as desserts, sauces, and bakery products. This type of cream is preferred by consumers who seek indulgent, creamy products with a fuller taste and thicker consistency. Its versatile usage in both sweet and savory dishes contributes significantly to its demand across households, hotels, and restaurants in Germany. This segment continues to maintain a dominant share in the market due to its premium appeal and superior flavor profile, which aligns well with traditional German food culture.<p>The low-fat ultra-pasteurized double cream segment is gradually gaining traction, especially among health-conscious consumers. This variant offers a reduced fat content without compromising on taste and texture, appealing to those who want to enjoy the richness of cream while maintaining a healthier diet. As the trend toward healthier eating continues to rise, more consumers are opting for low-fat alternatives in their cooking and baking practices. This shift is also influenced by an increasing awareness of dietary fat consumption and its impact on health.
