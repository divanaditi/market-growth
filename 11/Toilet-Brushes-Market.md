Manual toilet brushes dominate the market due to their affordability and simple design. These brushes typically consist of a handle and bristles made of synthetic materials, offering a wide range of options in terms of styles, sizes, and durability. Manual toilet brushes are commonly used in both residential and commercial settings, providing an effective cleaning solution with minimal maintenance. They are particularly preferred by consumers looking for cost-effective cleaning tools that deliver reliable results without the need for complex technology or power sources. As hygiene awareness increases, the demand for durable and easy-to-use manual toilet brushes continues to grow across various segments in Germany. <p>On the other hand, automatic toilet brushes are gaining traction as an advanced solution in the market. These brushes feature self-cleaning mechanisms or motorized functions, reducing the need for manual effort. Automatic toilet brushes are often equipped with sensors that detect when cleaning is required, enhancing convenience and hygiene standards. Although they come at a higher price point, they are increasingly popular in premium residential and commercial settings where consumers prioritize automation, efficiency, and modern design. The growing trend of smart home products in Germany has also contributed to the adoption of automatic toilet brushes, as they align with the demand for technological innovation in everyday products.
