The most widely used type includes authoring tools, which are designed to help users create digital content such as eLearning modules, training manuals, and interactive courses. These tools provide essential features like templates, multimedia integration, and assessment capabilities, allowing organizations to develop tailored training programs efficiently. Additionally, learning management systems (LMS) play a critical role by managing, delivering, and tracking the training content, ensuring that it aligns with the learner's progress and organizational goals. These tools are increasingly being adopted by both corporate and educational sectors, due to their ability to streamline training processes and ensure consistency across large teams or student populations.</p><p>Another significant category in the market is simulation and gamification tools. These tools provide immersive training experiences by simulating real-world scenarios or incorporating game elements to engage learners.
