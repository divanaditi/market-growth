These trampolines are gaining popularity due to their versatility and space-saving features, appealing to individuals seeking low-impact exercise equipment or recreational options for small areas. They are often used for fitness purposes, such as rebounding or cardio workouts, and are built with compact frames and materials suitable for indoor environments.
