Active monitoring tools involve simulating user interactions with web applications, websites, and other online platforms to test their performance, functionality, and availability. These tools simulate traffic and monitor the system’s response to various stimuli, identifying potential bottlenecks or failures before they impact actual users. Active monitoring is essential for detecting issues in real-time and ensuring smooth user experiences. In Germany, industries with high digital traffic, like e-commerce and banking, heavily rely on these tools to enhance their service quality and minimize downtime.</p><p>On the other hand, passive monitoring tools work by analyzing data from real user interactions and existing system logs, without generating synthetic traffic.
