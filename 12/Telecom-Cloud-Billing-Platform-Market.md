The first segment is the subscription-based model, which is increasingly popular due to its predictable revenue structure and flexibility for both service providers and customers. This model allows telecom companies to offer a variety of services, including data storage, voice communication, and internet access, on a recurring billing basis.

Usage-based billing platforms also allow telecom providers to offer more granular pricing strategies, enabling them to meet the specific needs of different customer segments.
