Thermoplastic markings dominate the market due to their durability and visibility under various weather conditions, making them ideal for both urban and highway applications. These markings are often used in situations where long-lasting performance is crucial, such as during construction projects or events requiring temporary traffic regulation. Paint-based markings are also widely used, providing a cost-effective and versatile solution for temporary traffic management. They are quick to apply and remove, which makes them suitable for short-term uses like detours or traffic diversions during roadworks or public events. Lastly, adhesive markings are growing in popularity due to their ease of application and removal, typically seen in areas that require frequent changes in road layout or direction.</p><p>The segmentation also considers the different techniques used in the application of these temporary markings. Spray-based applications are commonly used for paint-based and adhesive markings, offering a quick and efficient method to mark roads during short-term roadwork. Roller and brush techniques are applied for more precise and controlled applications, especially for thermoplastic and paint-based markings, ensuring a long-lasting effect. The market is also seeing a shift towards more environmentally friendly solutions, with innovations in non-toxic and eco-friendly paints and materials that align with sustainability goals.
