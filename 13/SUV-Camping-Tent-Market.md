They are often compact, easy to store, and can be deployed quickly, which appeals to the modern traveler seeking both convenience and comfort during outdoor excursions.</p><p>Another prominent segment in the market includes the ground tents designed specifically for SUV camping.

Many models come with features such as awnings, windows, and ventilation systems to enhance comfort.
