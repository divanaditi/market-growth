The traditional fire fighting jacket is designed to provide basic protection against heat and flames, typically using materials like aramid or Nomex. These jackets are lightweight, durable, and offer sufficient safety in typical fire conditions. The demand for traditional jackets remains strong due to their affordability and effectiveness in various fire-fighting scenarios. Fire departments across Germany often choose this type of jacket for standard operations, as it balances protection with cost-efficiency. These jackets, while effective, have limitations in extreme conditions, leading to a gradual shift towards more advanced options.<p>Advanced protective fire fighting jackets, on the other hand, are equipped with innovative materials and enhanced features for superior performance. These jackets often incorporate multi-layer designs with thermal insulation, water-resistant coatings, and advanced flame-retardant fabrics that provide added protection in hazardous environments. As fire fighting techniques evolve and the need for greater protection increases, the demand for advanced jackets is growing in Germany. These jackets offer improved resistance to extreme temperatures and prolonged exposure to fire, making them ideal for high-risk fire-fighting operations.
