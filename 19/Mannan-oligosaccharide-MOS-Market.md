The increasing demand for functional foods and dietary supplements is a primary factor contributing to this growth. MOS, being a prebiotic, has gained popularity for its ability to promote gut health, enhance immune function, and support overall well-being. With the growing trend of natural ingredients in food and beverage products, MOS is projected to witness rising adoption rates across various sectors, including animal feed and human nutrition.</p>    <p>According to market analyses, the global MOS market was valued at approximately USD 120 million in 2024 and is expected to reach around USD 200 million by 2032. This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 6.5% during the forecast period from 2024 to 2032. The surge in the animal feed industry, particularly in the livestock and aquaculture segments, is anticipated to significantly bolster the demand for MOS. As more producers recognize the health benefits of MOS in enhancing animal performance and digestion, its incorporation into livestock diets is expected to grow.</p>    <p>Furthermore, the rise in the pet care industry is another crucial driver. Pet owners are increasingly opting for premium and health-centric products for their pets, leading to a higher demand for MOS in pet food formulations. The awareness regarding pet health and nutrition is encouraging manufacturers to innovate and incorporate more functional ingredients, including MOS.</p>    <p>Moreover, self-care trends have spurred interest in dietary supplements among health-conscious consumers. As a result, MOS has found a stable position within the supplement market, as consumers seek products that naturally enhance gut microbiota and improve health. The functional properties, combined with the clean-label trend, are likely to steer momentum in the MOS market forward.</p>        <code><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Modified Starch Market Report @</span>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/439728/?utm_source=github-R&amp;utm_medium=313">https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/439728/?utm_source=github-R&amp;utm_medium=313</a></p></code>        <p>Another noteworthy aspect contributing to MOS market growth is the increasing focus on sustainable sourcing and clean production processes.
