Synthetic camphene is commonly produced through the polymerization of terpenes, offering high purity and consistent quality. This form of camphene is preferred in industrial applications, especially in the fragrance, chemical, and pharmaceutical sectors. Its use as a solvent and intermediate in the production of various compounds further drives its demand. The synthetic variant is also valued for its ability to replicate the properties of natural camphene at a more affordable price point, which benefits manufacturers by providing a cost-effective alternative for large-scale production.<p>The natural camphene, derived from plant-based sources like turpentine oil, holds a significant portion of the market as well. This type of camphene is known for its distinct fragrance and is often used in the production of perfumes, cosmetics, and as a component in essential oils. Its appeal is rooted in its natural origin, making it attractive to industries and consumers seeking more sustainable and eco-friendly options. The natural form also finds applications in the food and beverage sector as a flavoring agent.
