Wet Distillers Grains are a byproduct of the ethanol production process and are often used as animal feed due to their high moisture content and nutritional value. They are particularly beneficial for livestock, including cattle and poultry, as they provide a rich source of protein and fiber. Due to their high moisture levels, WDG must be used quickly or processed into dry forms for longer storage. This segment of the market is driven by the growing demand for cost-effective and high-nutrient animal feed in Germany's agricultural industry. <p>Dry Distillers Grains (DDG), on the other hand, are processed and dried to remove the moisture content, making them more convenient for long-term storage and transportation. DDGs are commonly used in the animal feed industry as a protein-rich supplement for livestock, particularly in dairy and beef cattle farming. They offer a concentrated nutrient profile, which is ideal for enhancing livestock growth and productivity.
