Retail brokers focus on serving individual clients and small businesses by offering personalized insurance solutions. These brokers cater to a wide range of insurance products, such as health, life, property, and casualty insurance. Retail brokers typically establish long-term relationships with their clients, advising on the best coverage options to meet specific needs. They play a crucial role in simplifying the complex insurance process for individuals, ensuring that policyholders have the right coverage for their personal or business requirements. Retail brokers are particularly popular in Germany due to their ability to provide customized solutions and their deep understanding of local insurance regulations.<p>On the other hand, wholesale brokers specialize in dealing with large corporate clients and facilitating complex insurance placements. These brokers work with other smaller brokers or directly with insurers to secure specialized coverage for large-scale businesses and industries. Wholesale brokers typically have in-depth knowledge of the commercial insurance market and its intricacies, including underwriting, risk management, and regulatory compliance.
