Silicone lacrimal stents dominate the market due to their high biocompatibility, flexibility, and ease of insertion. These stents are commonly used in the treatment of chronic lacrimal duct obstructions and other related conditions. Their versatility makes them suitable for both short-term and long-term applications, contributing to their widespread adoption in medical practices. Additionally, the silicone material ensures that the stents remain in place and maintain proper drainage, reducing the risk of complications during and after procedures. This type is particularly preferred in surgical procedures that require a stable and durable solution for tear drainage management.<p>Non-silicone lacrimal stents, which include materials such as plastic, are also gaining popularity due to their advanced properties, including enhanced comfort and reduced risk of irritation. These stents are often designed for specific cases where the use of silicone may not be ideal, such as in patients with allergies or sensitivities.
