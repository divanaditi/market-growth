Oral Naltrexone is the most common form, widely used for the treatment of opioid and alcohol dependence. The oral tablets offer ease of administration and are favored for outpatient treatment plans. They are typically prescribed for long-term use to reduce cravings and prevent relapse, providing a non-invasive approach. Additionally, the oral form is preferred for patients who are looking for a daily medication regimen and a convenient treatment option for managing their addiction.</p><p>Injectable Naltrexone, on the other hand, is gaining popularity in Germany due to its longer-lasting effects and convenience. Administered as an intramuscular injection, this formulation is typically given once a month. It offers patients the benefit of consistent medication adherence without the need for daily dosing.
