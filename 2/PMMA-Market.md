Extrusion grade PMMA is widely used for applications such as glazing, signage, and lighting, due to its high transparency, UV stability, and ease of processing. This type is often preferred for mass production of sheets, films, and profiles, where consistent quality and high efficiency are crucial. The demand for extrusion grade PMMA is growing as industries like automotive, construction, and advertising seek durable, cost-effective materials that can withstand harsh environmental conditions while maintaining aesthetic appeal. Extrusion-grade PMMA’s high adaptability and optical clarity make it a popular choice in both functional and decorative applications.<p>The molding grade PMMA segment, on the other hand, is primarily utilized for more specialized applications such as automotive components, medical devices, and lenses. Molding grade PMMA offers exceptional dimensional stability, high surface quality, and impact resistance, which makes it suitable for intricate moldings with precise specifications. It is frequently used in manufacturing optical lenses, lighting components, and medical implants, where clarity, strength, and resistance to environmental factors are crucial.
