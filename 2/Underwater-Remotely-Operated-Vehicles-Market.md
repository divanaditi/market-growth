Light-duty ROVs are typically smaller, more compact, and designed for less complex operations such as inspections, maintenance, and data collection in shallow waters. These vehicles are widely used in the oil and gas industry, marine research, and environmental monitoring due to their affordability, ease of deployment, and adaptability to various underwater tasks. With advancements in technology, light-duty ROVs are becoming increasingly efficient and equipped with sophisticated sensors and cameras to enhance their functionality in various underwater applications. The demand for light-duty ROVs is growing, driven by their widespread usage in both commercial and scientific sectors, particularly for routine underwater inspections and surveys.<p>On the other hand, heavy-duty ROVs are built for deep-sea exploration and more complex underwater tasks. These ROVs are engineered to handle demanding environments, such as deep-water oil and gas exploration, subsea construction, and underwater mining operations. Heavy-duty ROVs are equipped with powerful thrusters, heavy lifting capabilities, and specialized tools to perform intricate tasks at great depths. The growing interest in deep-sea exploration and offshore oil extraction, along with the increasing demand for underwater inspection and repair services, is expected to drive the market for heavy-duty ROVs.
