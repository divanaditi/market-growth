As such, they have captured a large portion of the vending machine market in Germany, although their growth rate is gradually slowing due to the rise of more sophisticated options.<p>On the other hand, advanced vending machines are gaining traction, driven by innovation in technology. These machines are often equipped with features such as touchscreens, cashless payment systems, and even biometric authentication, offering enhanced customer experience and convenience. They can dispense a wider range of products, from fresh meals to electronics, and cater to a broader audience with customized offerings. Moreover, these machines are increasingly becoming eco-friendly with energy-efficient designs and sustainable product choices. The demand for such vending machines is growing rapidly, especially in urban areas and commercial establishments where consumer expectations for convenience and technology integration are higher.
