According to recent market research, the global IP financing market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 12.5% from 2024 to 2032.</p>        <p>In 2024, the market size is estimated to be around $5.2 billion. By 2025, it is expected to reach $5.9 billion. As innovative financing solutions continue to emerge, more businesses are likely to explore monetizing their IP through various financing avenues. Continued investments in technology to enhance IP valuation and transaction efficiency are also expected to play a crucial role in market expansion.
