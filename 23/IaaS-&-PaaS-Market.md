<h1>Growth and Future Outlook of the IaaS & PaaS Market</h1>        <p>The Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) markets have been experiencing substantial growth over the last few years, driven primarily by the rapid adoption of cloud computing and increasing demand for scalable and flexible technological solutions. In 2024, the IaaS market is projected to be valued at approximately $120 billion, reflecting a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 20% through to 2032. This demand is largely fueled by businesses transitioning from traditional IT infrastructures to cloud-based systems, which not only reduce operational costs but also enhance efficiency and scalability.</p>        <p>Similarly, the PaaS market is expected to follow a parallel trajectory. With a projected value of $70 billion in 2024, the PaaS sector is set to grow at a CAGR of around 25% through 2032. This growth can be attributed to an increasing need for development tools that facilitate application design, development, and deployment without incurring substantial upfront costs. Enterprises benefit significantly from PaaS solutions due to their ability to speed up the development lifecycle, reduce time to market, and foster innovation.</p>        <p><strong><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Modified Starch Market Report @</span>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/492154/?utm_source=github-R&amp;utm_medium=313">https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/492154/?utm_source=github-R&amp;utm_medium=313</a></p></strong></p>        <p>As we look forward to 2027, the IaaS market is forecasted to reach approximately $200 billion, while the PaaS market is anticipated to climb to about $130 billion.
