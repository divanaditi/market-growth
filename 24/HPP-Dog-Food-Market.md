<h1>Growth and Future Outlook of the HPP Dog Food Market</h1>    <p>The HPP (High Pressure Processing) dog food market is experiencing significant growth driven by increasing consumer demand for premium pet food products. As pet owners become more conscious of their pets' dietary needs, they are leaning towards fresh and minimally processed food options. The HPP method, which involves applying high pressure to food, helps preserve nutritional quality while extending shelf life without the need for preservatives.

It is projected to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 8% from 2024 to 2032.
