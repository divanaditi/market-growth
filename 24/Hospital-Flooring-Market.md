By 2032, the market size is expected to reach nearly $3.5 billion, reflective of the continued expansion of healthcare facilities across the globe. This upward trend signifies not only an increase in the number of hospitals being constructed but also in the renovation of existing facilities that require updated flooring solutions.</p>    <p>Furthermore, the emerging trend of sustainable and eco-friendly flooring materials is likely to reshape the hospital flooring landscape. With the growing awareness around environmental impact, hospitals are increasingly seeking materials that comply with green building standards.
