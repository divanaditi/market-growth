<h1>Growth and Future Outlook in the Purified Protein Derivative Market</h1>    <p>The purified protein derivative (PPD) market is witnessing significant growth fueled by the increasing prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) and heightened awareness of early diagnosis and treatment. The global PPD market is projected to grow from approximately USD 800 million in 2024 to around USD 1.2 billion by 2032. This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 5.5% during the forecast period. The rising incidence of TB, along with stringent regulations and guidelines aimed at eradicating the disease, is a critical driver of market expansion.</p>    <p>Moreover, the increasing focus on preventive healthcare and regular screenings for tuberculosis, particularly in high-risk areas, has increased the demand for purified protein derivatives. Innovations in healthcare technologies, including advanced diagnostic tools and research initiatives, are expected to further propel market growth. Long-term government funding and support for TB control programs also contribute positively to the market dynamics, enabling wider access to PPD for diagnostic purposes.</p>    <p id="download-sample"><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Modified Starch Market Report @</span>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/519698/?utm_source=github-R&amp;utm_medium=322">https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/519698/?utm_source=github-R&amp;utm_medium=322</a></p></p>    <p>During the projected period from 2024 to 2032, the purified protein derivative market is expected to experience several trends shaping its future.
