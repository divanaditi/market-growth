Static shock collars deliver a mild electric shock to the dog as a corrective measure, providing an effective way to discourage unwanted behaviors like excessive barking or aggression. These collars are often used for dogs that have developed bad habits or are difficult to control. Vibration collars, on the other hand, use a gentle vibration to get the dog’s attention without causing any pain. They are considered a more humane alternative and are widely used for training dogs to follow commands and correct behavior. Finally, sonic collars emit a sound that is only audible to the dog, used mainly for behavior correction and focusing the dog’s attention.
