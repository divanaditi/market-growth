Standard incubators are widely used in research and diagnostic labs for cultivating bacterial, fungal, and other microbial cultures. They are designed to maintain a constant temperature, which is essential for microbial growth. Refrigerated incubators, on the other hand, are equipped with temperature control systems that allow the storage of cultures at lower temperatures, making them ideal for applications requiring preservation of microbial samples. These incubators are frequently used in pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, where precise temperature regulation is vital to avoid the degradation of sensitive samples and cultures.</p><p>CO2 incubators, another significant segment, provide an environment with controlled levels of carbon dioxide and humidity, mimicking the conditions of a living organism. These incubators are critical in cell culture applications, particularly in research related to tissue engineering, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical development. The demand for CO2 incubators is driven by the increasing need for advanced research and development activities in these fields.
