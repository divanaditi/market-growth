These products are typically available as creams, ointments, or sprays, and are applied directly to the affected area. The growing awareness of personal hygiene and preventive care has contributed to the increased demand for topical anti-infectives, especially among consumers seeking non-prescription solutions for everyday ailments. Furthermore, advancements in product formulations and the inclusion of natural ingredients have boosted the popularity of these products in the OTC market. These factors are expected to drive the growth of the topical anti-infective segment in the coming years in Germany.<p>On the other hand, systemic anti-infectives, including oral antibiotics and antivirals, are also a significant part of the OTC anti-infective market in Germany. These products are used to manage infections such as colds, flu, and other common bacterial and viral infections. The demand for oral antibiotics and antiviral medications has risen due to the increased self-medication trends among consumers and the ease of access to over-the-counter options. Additionally, the growing prevalence of seasonal infections and an aging population further support the demand for systemic anti-infectives. With continued innovation in drug formulations and the increasing consumer preference for convenient, fast-acting remedies, the systemic anti-infective segment is poised for steady growth.
