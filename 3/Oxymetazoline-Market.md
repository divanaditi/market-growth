Nasal sprays dominate the market due to their widespread use in relieving nasal congestion caused by conditions like the common cold, allergies, and sinusitis. The demand for nasal sprays is driven by their fast-acting nature, easy application, and effectiveness in providing quick relief from blocked nasal passages. They are typically available in over-the-counter formulations, making them easily accessible to consumers. Furthermore, the increasing prevalence of respiratory diseases and the rise in allergy-related conditions among the German population are contributing to the growing consumption of nasal spray products. The convenience and cost-effectiveness of nasal sprays make them a preferred choice for many individuals seeking non-prescription relief from nasal congestion.<p>Eye drops, on the other hand, are gaining traction in the market due to their effectiveness in treating eye-related issues such as redness, irritation, and dryness caused by allergies or environmental factors.
