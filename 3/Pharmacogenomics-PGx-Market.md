The first segment includes the DNA-based testing, which is the most prevalent method used to identify genetic variations that influence drug response. This segment is highly driven by advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, which allows for more comprehensive analysis of genetic markers. DNA-based testing plays a critical role in precision medicine, enabling healthcare providers to tailor drug therapies according to individual genetic profiles. This results in enhanced therapeutic efficacy, reduced adverse drug reactions, and more personalized treatments for patients suffering from various conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and psychiatric disorders. The growing emphasis on personalized healthcare and the increasing adoption of NGS platforms further boost the demand for DNA-based PGx testing in Germany.</p><p>The second segment is the RNA-based pharmacogenomics testing, which is gaining significant traction due to its ability to analyze gene expression profiles and assess how these profiles affect drug metabolism and response. RNA-based testing provides valuable insights into how certain genetic variations affect the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drugs, facilitating more accurate dosing decisions and personalized therapy plans. This type of testing is particularly important for understanding the role of non-coding RNA and post-transcriptional modifications in drug response.
