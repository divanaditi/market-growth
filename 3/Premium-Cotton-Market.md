Organic cotton has gained significant traction due to increasing consumer demand for eco-friendly and sustainable products. This type of cotton is grown without synthetic chemicals or pesticides, aligning with the growing trend of health-conscious and environmentally aware consumers. As a result, organic cotton has seen a steady rise in demand from both textile manufacturers and end consumers who prioritize sustainability. Germany's strong commitment to environmental initiatives has further boosted the growth of organic cotton in various sectors, particularly in fashion and home textiles, where eco-certifications play a crucial role in purchasing decisions.</p><p>On the other hand, conventional cotton continues to maintain a dominant share of the market. While its growth rate is slower compared to organic cotton, conventional cotton is still favored due to its affordability and widespread availability. It is widely used in the production of various textile products, including garments, bedding, and other fabric-based goods. Conventional cotton’s high yield and well-established supply chains make it a reliable choice for many manufacturers.
