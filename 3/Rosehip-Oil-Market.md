Cold-pressed rosehip oil is one of the most popular types, widely favored for its natural extraction process that preserves the oil's beneficial properties. This method involves pressing the seeds of the rosehip fruit without using heat, ensuring the retention of vital nutrients like fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins. Cold-pressed rosehip oil is highly valued in the cosmetics and skincare industry for its ability to hydrate, repair skin, and reduce scars. It is also used in anti-aging formulations due to its high content of essential fatty acids and antioxidants.
