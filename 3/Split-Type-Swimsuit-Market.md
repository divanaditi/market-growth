Bikini-style swimsuits are characterized by their two-piece design, which provides a versatile and stylish option for individuals seeking a more traditional and trendy swimwear choice. These swimsuits are popular due to their comfort, ease of movement, and variety of designs, making them a staple in both casual beachwear and competitive swimming markets. With an increasing demand for stylish and functional swimwear, the bikini-style segment continues to thrive, appealing to diverse customer preferences and body types. The flexibility and ability to mix and match different tops and bottoms also drive the popularity of this category among consumers.<p>On the other hand, high-waist split type swimsuits are gaining traction for their retro-inspired look and enhanced coverage.
