The on-premise SDMP type has been widely adopted by enterprises looking to have greater control over their data management processes. This deployment method allows organizations to store and manage subscriber data in their own infrastructure, ensuring better security and compliance with local regulations. The on-premise model is preferred by industries that handle sensitive data, such as telecom, banking, and government, due to the higher customization capabilities and data privacy it offers. Despite the high initial cost and maintenance challenges, the demand for on-premise SDMP solutions remains robust in Germany due to their reliability and scalability.<p>On the other hand, the cloud-based SDMP type is gaining significant traction in the German market. This model offers flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency by enabling organizations to store and manage subscriber data on third-party cloud platforms. Cloud-based SDMP solutions are particularly favored by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) due to lower upfront investments and reduced IT maintenance requirements. The growing trend of digitalization and the need for real-time data access have propelled the adoption of cloud-based platforms.
