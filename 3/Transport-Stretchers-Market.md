They are typically lightweight, easy to maneuver, and come in various designs to accommodate different patient needs. Manual stretchers are a popular choice in hospitals, ambulances, and other emergency settings where budget constraints or a need for mobility is a consideration. This type of stretcher remains a staple in the industry due to its versatility and reliability in routine patient transportation.<p>Powered stretchers, on the other hand, incorporate electric or battery-powered systems to assist with lifting and adjusting the patient’s position, offering improved comfort and ease of use. These stretchers are particularly beneficial in reducing physical strain on healthcare professionals during patient handling, particularly in intensive care units and emergency services. They are designed for use in high-demand environments where quick, efficient, and safe patient transport is critical. Powered stretchers often come with advanced features like height adjustment, tilt, and backrest adjustment, making them ideal for patients with specific medical conditions.
