This type of service is especially attractive to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that may not have the financial resources to purchase trucks outright but still need reliable transportation solutions to meet customer demands. The vehicle leasing market is expected to grow steadily as businesses continue to prefer rental options over ownership for cost-effective fleet management.</p><p>Fleet management services, on the other hand, focus on the management and optimization of an entire fleet of trucks, providing businesses with comprehensive solutions for logistics, route planning, fuel management, and maintenance tracking.

By utilizing advanced telematics and IoT technology, fleet management services can offer real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and improved operational efficiency. This segment is gaining traction as businesses look for ways to enhance their logistical operations while reducing operational costs and downtime.
