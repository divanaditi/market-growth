<h1>Growth and Future Outlook of the Medical Disposable Masks Market</h1>    <p>The global market for medical disposable masks has experienced significant growth due to the increased awareness of hygiene and infection control, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. As healthcare facilities, frontline workers, and the general public have become more conscious of the importance of protective equipment, the demand for disposable masks has surged. This spike in demand is expected to continue as governments and health authorities emphasize the need for protective gear in both clinical and non-clinical settings.</p>        <p>According to recent projections, the medical disposable masks market is expected to reach a size of approximately <strong>$10 billion</strong> by the end of 2024.
