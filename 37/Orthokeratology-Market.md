The visibility of these treatment options has increased through social media and online platforms, leading to higher consumer interest and acceptance.</p>        <p>In addition, advancements in lens technology have improved the comfort and effectiveness of orthokeratology treatments.

By 2032, the market could potentially reach a value of <strong>$5 billion</strong>, reflecting the increasing adoption of orthokeratology lenses and the expanding demographic of Myopia patients.</p>        <p>Furthermore, educational initiatives being introduced by eye care professionals and organizations about the benefits of orthokeratology are crucial in fostering acceptance among parents of myopic children.
