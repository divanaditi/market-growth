One of the primary types is the steel AST, which is commonly used due to its durability, strength, and resistance to various environmental conditions. Steel ASTs are widely employed for storing liquids such as petroleum, chemicals, and water. They are preferred in many industrial sectors due to their long lifespan and ability to withstand pressure and temperature fluctuations. Furthermore, steel ASTs are available in both vertical and horizontal configurations, depending on storage needs and space requirements. These tanks offer excellent structural integrity and can be equipped with various safety features to prevent leakage or other hazards, making them an ideal choice for hazardous materials storage.<p>Another significant type of AST in the German market is the fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP) tank. FRP ASTs are gaining popularity due to their lightweight nature, corrosion resistance, and cost-effectiveness. These tanks are widely used in industries such as chemicals, food processing, and pharmaceuticals, where corrosion resistance is crucial for storing a variety of substances. FRP tanks are not only durable but also easier to maintain compared to their steel counterparts. The low maintenance cost and resistance to environmental factors make them an appealing option for industries looking for a longer-term storage solution.
