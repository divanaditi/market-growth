Soluble apple fiber powder is derived from the pulp and skin of apples and is known for its high water-binding properties. This type of fiber is often used in functional foods and beverages, promoting gut health and aiding in digestion. It also provides a natural thickening agent and is favored for its potential to support cholesterol management. The increasing demand for natural and healthy ingredients in the food industry has spurred the growth of soluble apple fiber powder, especially in formulations targeting weight management and digestive wellness products.

This type of fiber is particularly beneficial in baked goods, snacks, and dietary supplements, where it helps improve texture and nutritional value. The demand for insoluble apple fiber powder is driven by the rising awareness of the importance of fiber in diet, as well as the growing preference for plant-based and natural dietary components.
