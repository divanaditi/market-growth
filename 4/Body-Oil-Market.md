Essential oils, derived from natural plant extracts, are gaining significant traction due to their therapeutic properties and holistic benefits. These oils, including lavender, peppermint, and eucalyptus, are popular among consumers seeking products for relaxation, stress relief, and skincare. As more consumers prioritize organic and natural ingredients, essential oils have become a staple in body care routines, driving their demand in the market. The growing trend of aromatherapy and the rising awareness of the benefits of essential oils for health and wellness have further contributed to their widespread popularity in Germany.</p><p>On the other hand, non-essential oils such as mineral oil and synthetic oils also hold a considerable market share. These oils are widely used for their moisturizing and skin-softening properties, often featured in affordable, mass-market body oil products. While they may lack the therapeutic attributes of essential oils, non-essential oils are still in high demand due to their cost-effectiveness and effectiveness in providing hydration.
