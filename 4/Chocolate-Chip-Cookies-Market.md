Soft cookies are known for their moist and chewy texture, which appeals to consumers who prefer a more indulgent and fresh experience. These cookies are often preferred by younger demographics and are commonly available in larger retail stores, supermarkets, and online platforms. Their soft consistency is achieved by adjusting the baking process and using specific ingredients such as butter and brown sugar. The demand for soft chocolate chip cookies continues to grow due to their association with premium and homemade qualities, contributing to their increasing popularity among German consumers.</p><p>On the other hand, crunchy chocolate chip cookies have a more brittle and crisp texture, making them a popular choice for those who enjoy a satisfying crunch in every bite. These cookies tend to have a longer shelf life and are often packaged in various sizes for convenience. They are a preferred choice for consumers looking for snacks that are easy to store and transport. Crunchy chocolate chip cookies are also typically available in a range of flavors and variations, such as reduced sugar or gluten-free, catering to health-conscious and dietary-sensitive consumers.
