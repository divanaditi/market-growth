Copper sulphate fertilizers are commonly used for their high efficacy in addressing copper deficiencies in soils. These fertilizers are widely applied in both agricultural and horticultural sectors, where crops like cereals, vegetables, and fruits show high sensitivity to copper deficiency. Copper sulphate, being highly soluble, allows for quick absorption by plants, promoting healthy root development, strong disease resistance, and overall plant growth. Its application is particularly prevalent in the cultivation of potatoes, tomatoes, and grapes, where copper is an essential micronutrient for achieving high yields. The growing demand for these fertilizers is driven by increased agricultural productivity and the need for soil health maintenance in Germany's diverse farming landscape.<p>On the other hand, copper oxychloride-based fertilizers are gaining popularity in the German market due to their dual function as both a nutrient and a pesticide. This type of fertilizer is used not only to replenish copper levels in soil but also to protect crops from fungal and bacterial diseases, making it especially valuable in integrated pest management strategies. Copper oxychloride is less soluble than copper sulphate, providing a slower release of copper to plants, which helps maintain optimal nutrient levels over a longer period.
