Among the key types, rotary dental burs hold a significant market share due to their wide usage in cutting, shaping, and polishing teeth. These burs are commonly employed in restorative dentistry, especially for cavity preparation and crown fitting. Additionally, carbide dental burs are particularly popular because of their ability to efficiently cut through hard tooth material. The demand for these high-performance burs is driven by their precision and durability, which is crucial for complex dental procedures. The growth of restorative and preventive dental care in Germany further fuels the market for such types, as more patients seek advanced dental treatments that require specialized equipment, such as rotary and carbide burs, for optimal results and patient comfort. <p>Another notable segment of the market includes diamond dental burs, which are highly valued for their abrasive properties.
