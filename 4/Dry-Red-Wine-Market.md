Other notable types include Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Syrah, each bringing distinct characteristics such as rich tannins and deep color to the wine. The demand for these wines is largely driven by consumer preferences for sophisticated and balanced flavor profiles, which dry red wines are known for.
