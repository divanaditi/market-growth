Spray paints are the most commonly used product in graffiti creation due to their versatility and ease of application on various surfaces. These paints provide a smooth and consistent finish, making them ideal for large-scale murals and vibrant artwork. Their popularity is driven by their availability in a wide range of colors, ensuring that graffiti artists can express their creativity without limitations. Additionally, spray paints are often formulated to be weather-resistant, which is essential for outdoor art installations. As a result, they hold a significant share in the market, particularly in urban areas where street art is prominent.
