The most common categories include front cameras, rear cameras, and surround view systems. Front cameras, which are typically mounted on the vehicle's front grille or windshield, assist in providing forward visibility and are crucial for features like lane departure warning and collision detection. Rear cameras, primarily used for parking assistance, improve the driver’s rearview vision, reducing blind spots and preventing accidents. These camera types contribute significantly to enhancing overall vehicle safety. CMOS sensor technology has become the preferred choice for automotive cameras due to its high resolution, low power consumption, and ability to function well in low-light conditions, offering enhanced performance for drivers. <p>Additionally, surround view systems are gaining traction in the market, offering a comprehensive view of the vehicle's surroundings. These systems integrate multiple cameras placed around the vehicle, providing a 360-degree view to assist in parking and low-speed maneuvering, further minimizing the risk of accidents. As the demand for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) increases, CMOS cameras are expected to play a pivotal role in enabling features like automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, and pedestrian detection. Moreover, these cameras contribute to the development of autonomous driving technology, where accurate real-time imagery is essential.
