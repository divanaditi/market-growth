Harness-type leashes are designed to secure the child’s body with adjustable straps, offering increased comfort and control for both parents and children. These leashes are popular among parents who seek enhanced safety, especially for toddlers and younger children. Harnesses are often padded and feature a design that reduces strain on the child’s body, ensuring that the child does not feel restrained while still maintaining secure control. These products are particularly beneficial in crowded public spaces, where the risk of losing sight of a child is higher. Additionally, harness-type leashes come in various styles and colors, attracting parents looking for both functionality and aesthetics.<p>Wrist-type leashes, on the other hand, are designed with a strap that connects the child’s wrist to the parent’s wrist, allowing for greater freedom of movement.
