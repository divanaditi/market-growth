These displays are commonly found in billboards, transportation hubs, and public spaces. Outdoor signage is engineered for durability, often using weather-resistant materials to maintain performance across different climates. The adoption of outdoor LED signage is growing due to its effectiveness in large-scale advertising campaigns and its ability to reach a wider audience.
