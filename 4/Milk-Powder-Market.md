Infant milk powder holds a significant share due to the increasing demand for nutritionally enhanced products for infants and toddlers. This segment benefits from the growing awareness among parents about the importance of a balanced diet during early stages of life. Additionally, innovations in the formulation of infant milk powder, including organic and fortified varieties, have further contributed to the expansion of this segment. With Germany being a key market in Europe for baby food products, the demand for premium and specialized infant milk powders continues to rise, driven by evolving consumer preferences for healthier and more sustainable food options for young children.<p>Adult milk powder, on the other hand, caters to a different consumer demographic, primarily targeting health-conscious adults, athletes, and the elderly. This segment has seen growth due to the increasing popularity of functional foods that support weight management, muscle recovery, and overall wellness. In Germany, the demand for adult milk powder is driven by its high protein content and convenience as a meal replacement or supplement. Additionally, the rise of lactose-free and organic adult milk powders has further contributed to the market's growth, appealing to consumers with specific dietary needs or preferences.
