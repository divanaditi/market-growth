Nebulizer cups are critical for holding the medication solution, ensuring the consistent delivery of aerosolized medicine. The demand for these accessories is increasing due to the rising prevalence of respiratory diseases and the growing awareness of effective respiratory treatments.

Lastly, mouthpieces are used by patients who prefer direct inhalation of the medication.
