Rubber gaskets, often made from materials such as nitrile, silicone, and EPDM, dominate the market due to their excellent sealing capabilities, flexibility, and resistance to harsh environmental conditions. These gaskets are widely used in industries like automotive, construction, and machinery. Elastomer gaskets, with their outstanding durability and resistance to chemicals, are also growing in demand, particularly in the food and beverage and chemical processing sectors. PTFE gaskets, known for their exceptional chemical resistance and thermal stability, are primarily utilized in the pharmaceutical and petrochemical industries where high-performance sealing is required in extreme conditions. The increasing need for efficient and cost-effective sealing solutions drives the demand for these non-metallic gasket types across Germany’s diverse industrial landscape.<p>The demand for non-metallic gaskets in Germany is also influenced by factors like material properties, application-specific requirements, and industry trends. Among the different types, rubber gaskets are particularly sought after for their versatility and ease of manufacturing. They provide reliable sealing performance even in high-pressure and temperature conditions, making them ideal for automotive engines, HVAC systems, and pipeline applications. Elastomer gaskets, which offer enhanced resistance to abrasion and wear, are being increasingly adopted in industries that require long-lasting sealing solutions in high-speed operations. PTFE gaskets, owing to their ability to withstand extreme chemical environments, are crucial for industries involved in handling aggressive substances or in cleanroom settings.
