Gas stoves hold a significant market share due to their convenience, ease of use, and portability. These stoves typically use butane, propane, or a combination of both, offering fast ignition and temperature control.

They are especially favored for short trips or situations requiring quick setup and cooking. This has led to the widespread adoption of gas-powered models in the market, with advancements in technology improving their safety features and performance under various weather conditions. <p>Multi-fuel stoves, another notable segment, cater to adventurers looking for versatility.
