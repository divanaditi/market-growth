Garment bags are ideal for individuals needing to keep their clothes wrinkle-free during travel, often preferred by business travelers or those attending formal events. Trolley bags, which come with built-in wheels and telescopic handles, are popular for their ease of use and portability. These bags are designed to reduce the strain on the user, providing an effortless travel experience. The market also sees an increasing demand for eco-friendly and durable options, with consumers showing a preference for sustainable materials and innovative designs.
