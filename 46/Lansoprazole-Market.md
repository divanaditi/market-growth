The forecast for the coming years shows that this market is expected to exhibit a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 5.2% from 2024 to 2032. By the end of 2032, the market size is projected to reach approximately $4 billion. This growth can be attributed to increasing awareness among patients regarding gastrointestinal health and the expanding patient population seeking effective treatments.     </p>    <p>        <strong><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Modified Starch Market Report @</span>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/859568/?utm_source=github-R&amp;utm_medium=316">https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/859568/?utm_source=github-R&amp;utm_medium=316</a></p></strong>    </p>    <p>        The demand for lansoprazole is anticipated to surge, particularly in emerging markets where healthcare infrastructure is improving and access to medications is increasing.
