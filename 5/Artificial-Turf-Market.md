Its ability to withstand heavy use while providing a consistent playing surface has made it popular for football, soccer, and other recreational sports. Furthermore, tufted turf offers various options in terms of pile height, density, and color, enhancing its adaptability for different customer needs.<p>On the other hand, woven artificial turf, known for its superior durability and high-end aesthetic appeal, is increasingly gaining traction in the German market, especially for premium applications.
