Passive Keyless Entry systems use advanced sensor technology to detect the presence of the key fob and automatically unlock the doors when the user approaches the vehicle. This seamless functionality has made PKE systems popular in premium vehicles, where convenience and security are paramount. The increasing demand for high-tech automotive solutions is driving the growth of PKE systems, with innovations such as proximity sensors and smartphone integrations enhancing their appeal. The rising adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles is further supporting the demand for PKE solutions, as consumers seek more intuitive and hands-free experiences.<p>Remote Keyless Entry systems, on the other hand, operate using radio frequency signals to unlock and lock doors remotely, offering a more traditional approach to keyless entry. RKE systems are widely used in mid-range and budget-friendly vehicles due to their cost-effectiveness and reliable performance.
