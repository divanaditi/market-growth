One of the key types is Mazut M-100, which is widely utilized for industrial heating purposes and in power plants due to its high energy content and lower cost compared to other fuels. Mazut M-100 is often employed in large-scale boilers and furnaces, contributing to its popularity in the energy and manufacturing sectors. This type of Mazut is preferred for its stability and ability to withstand high temperatures, making it an ideal fuel for industries requiring continuous and reliable energy. Its demand in Germany is driven by the need for alternative fuels to support energy production and manufacturing processes while adhering to cost-efficiency measures.<p>Another significant type within the German Mazut market is Mazut M-50. This variant has a lower sulfur content and is commonly used in specific industrial applications, such as marine transportation and heating. Its demand is growing due to stricter environmental regulations in Germany, which encourage the use of fuels with lower emissions.
