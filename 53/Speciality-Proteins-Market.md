Key factors contributing to this growth include the expansion of the food and beverage industry, innovations in protein processing technology, and a rising awareness of the health benefits associated with specialty proteins.</p>    <p>One of the most notable trends is the increase in product diversification, where manufacturers are exploring new sources of specialty proteins, including insect protein and algae-based options.
