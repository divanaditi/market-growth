Light quadricycles, often considered a subset of low-speed vehicles, are typically designed for urban use with smaller engines and limited top speeds. These vehicles have gained popularity in city environments, where their compact size and lower operational costs make them an attractive alternative to traditional cars. The growing demand for environmentally friendly transportation options, along with stricter emissions regulations, has also contributed to the increasing adoption of light quadricycles. In addition, these vehicles are often favored by young drivers and those looking for an affordable and flexible means of transportation within metropolitan areas.<p>Heavy quadricycles, on the other hand, are designed for higher speeds and are generally intended for off-road or recreational use.
