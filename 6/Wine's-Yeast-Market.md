One of the primary categories is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a widely used yeast species known for its high fermentation capacity and reliable performance. It is commonly utilized in producing a variety of wines, from dry whites to robust reds, due to its ability to efficiently convert sugars into alcohol. Another important yeast type in the market is non-Saccharomyces yeasts, which are gaining popularity due to their contribution to unique flavor profiles and complex aromas. These yeasts are often used in conjunction with Saccharomyces cerevisiae to enhance the sensory qualities of the wine, offering winemakers the flexibility to create distinctive and innovative products that appeal to changing consumer preferences.</p><p>In addition to these primary yeast types, the market also includes various specialty yeast strains tailored for specific wine varieties or production methods.
