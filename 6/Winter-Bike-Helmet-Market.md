Full-face helmets provide extensive protection, covering the entire head, including the chin and jaw, which is particularly important in colder weather conditions where injury risk may be higher due to icy or snowy terrain. These helmets are highly preferred by riders who engage in aggressive or downhill biking during the winter months, as they offer superior safety features and insulation. The market for full-face helmets is growing steadily as winter sports enthusiasts prioritize safety and comfort in challenging environmental conditions. Additionally, advancements in helmet design have made these full-face helmets more lightweight and breathable, catering to consumer demand for comfort in harsh weather.<p>On the other hand, open-face helmets are another popular category within the winter bike helmet market in Germany.
