Synthetic oils, on the other hand, offer increased durability and water resistance, making them ideal for high-traffic commercial spaces. These oils often contain additives that improve their ability to withstand wear and tear, moisture, and UV exposure. Hybrid oils combine both natural and synthetic components, offering a balance between eco-friendliness and performance, making them a popular choice in the market.</p><p>In the wood floor oiling services market, each type of oiling product serves distinct purposes based on the specific needs of the space.
