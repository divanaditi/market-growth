One of the most widely used types is pressure treatment equipment, which uses high-pressure systems to force preservatives deep into the wood, enhancing durability and resistance to decay, pests, and moisture. These systems are designed to handle large quantities of wood, making them ideal for industrial applications. Another prominent type is vacuum impregnation equipment, which employs a vacuum to remove air and moisture from the wood, allowing the preservative to be absorbed more effectively. This method is particularly suitable for smaller batches or specialized wood treatments, offering greater precision in the impregnation process. Both types are essential for various wood preservation applications, contributing significantly to the market’s growth in Germany.</p><p>In addition to pressure and vacuum impregnation equipment, thermal treatment equipment is also gaining traction in the German market. This method involves heating the wood to a specific temperature, enhancing its properties such as dimensional stability and resistance to fungal attack, without using chemical preservatives. This type of equipment is particularly valued for its eco-friendly approach, as it reduces the need for chemical additives.
