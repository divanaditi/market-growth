Pressure-treated wood stakes are commonly used for outdoor applications due to their enhanced durability and resistance to environmental factors such as moisture, insects, and rot. This makes them ideal for agricultural, construction, and landscaping projects where long-lasting performance is critical. The treatment process involves infusing the wood with preservatives that help protect it from decay, extending its lifespan in outdoor environments. These stakes are highly valued in sectors where wood's natural resistance to wear and tear is essential for longevity and functionality.</p><p>On the other hand, non-treated wood stakes are often used in less demanding applications, where the need for extended durability is minimal. These stakes are typically chosen for temporary or short-term use, such as for garden supports, fencing, or marking purposes.
