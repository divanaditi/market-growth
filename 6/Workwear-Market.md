Protective clothing, which is primarily designed to safeguard workers against workplace hazards, dominates the market. This category includes garments like safety jackets, flame-resistant clothing, high-visibility vests, and chemical-resistant suits. These products are widely used across industries such as manufacturing, construction, oil and gas, and chemicals, where employees are exposed to various risks. Increasing awareness regarding safety regulations, as well as the growing focus on worker well-being, has contributed to the higher demand for protective clothing in Germany. The rising number of industrial accidents and regulatory requirements for safety standards also play a significant role in driving the growth of this segment.<p>Non-protective clothing includes work uniforms, shirts, trousers, and other garments designed for comfort and durability rather than specific protective functions. While not intended to shield workers from hazardous environments, non-protective workwear is crucial for creating a professional and functional appearance in various sectors such as retail, hospitality, and corporate settings.
