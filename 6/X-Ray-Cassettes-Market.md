Film-based X-ray cassettes have been traditionally used in medical imaging and are widely recognized for their high image resolution. They consist of a photographic film enclosed in a cassette that helps capture the X-ray images. Although the adoption of digital cassettes has been increasing, film-based cassettes still hold a significant share of the market due to their cost-effectiveness and ease of use in many medical facilities. They are particularly favored in smaller clinics and settings where digital technologies are not yet fully implemented or are too expensive to upgrade. However, the demand for film-based cassettes is gradually declining as the healthcare industry shifts towards digital solutions that offer faster and more efficient imaging processes.</p><p>Digital X-ray cassettes are increasingly becoming the preferred choice in the Germany market due to their advanced features and benefits over traditional film-based systems. These cassettes use digital detectors that convert X-ray images into digital format, allowing for quicker image processing and superior image quality. They are highly valued for their ability to store and transfer images electronically, leading to more efficient workflows in medical settings.
