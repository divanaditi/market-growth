Synthetic carpets are the dominant segment, driven by their durability, resistance to water, and ease of maintenance. These carpets are commonly made from materials like polypropylene, nylon, and polyester, which offer advantages in terms of longevity and resistance to harsh marine environments. Synthetic fibers are particularly favored by yacht owners for their ability to withstand saltwater exposure, staining, and fading, ensuring they maintain their aesthetic appeal even in challenging conditions. Furthermore, the relatively lower cost of synthetic carpets makes them an attractive option for both luxury yachts and more budget-conscious boat owners.</p><p>Natural fiber carpets, including wool and sisal, are gaining traction in the market due to their luxurious appearance and eco-friendly characteristics.
