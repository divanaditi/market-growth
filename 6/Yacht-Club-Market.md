This type of yacht offers flexibility to those who wish to experience sailing without the long-term commitment of ownership. Yacht clubs in Germany that focus on charter services are becoming increasingly popular, as they allow individuals to enjoy the luxury of yachting while catering to different budget ranges and preferences.<p>Furthermore, the market includes sailing yachts and motor yachts, each serving distinct purposes.
