Liquid yeast autolysates are widely used in the food and beverage industry due to their ease of use and ability to enhance flavors and textures in products such as soups, sauces, and processed meats. These autolysates are rich in amino acids, peptides, and vitamins, making them ideal for applications where enhanced nutritional value and flavor complexity are required. Liquid autolysates are also favored for their ability to dissolve quickly, making them a preferred choice for manufacturers in the food sector looking for efficient production processes and consistent product quality. The liquid form maintains a high concentration of active compounds, which contributes to its popularity in functional foods and beverages as well as in animal feed.On the other hand, dry yeast autolysates are gaining traction due to their longer shelf life and ease of storage. These are particularly useful in industries where transport and logistics are a key consideration, as the dry form significantly reduces storage and transportation costs. Dry yeast autolysates are often utilized in the production of savory snacks, seasonings, and bakery products, offering a rich source of nutrients and improving the overall taste profile of the final products.
