This type of yeast also enhances gut health by promoting beneficial microbial activity, thus improving the overall immune response of animals. Another important segment is the Brewers’ yeast, which is often used as a supplement to improve the health and productivity of animals. It is particularly beneficial for poultry and swine, enhancing their intestinal microbiome and promoting the development of beneficial bacteria that support gut health and digestion.</p><p>Another key yeast probiotic in the German animal market is Saccharomyces boulardii, which is utilized mainly for its ability to combat digestive disorders and stress-related issues in animals. This probiotic strain is especially beneficial for animals under antibiotic treatment or those facing dietary changes. Its robust nature enables it to survive in challenging gut environments and exert its beneficial effects. Additionally, yeast extracts rich in mannans and beta-glucans are gaining popularity in the animal feed sector.
