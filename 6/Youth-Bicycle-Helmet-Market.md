Full-face helmets offer comprehensive protection by covering the entire head, including the chin and face. These helmets are typically favored by young riders who participate in more extreme biking activities, such as mountain biking or downhill racing. They provide an extra layer of safety in the event of a fall, reducing the risk of facial injuries and offering increased impact resistance.
