One of the major types is the LYSO single crystal, which is widely used in medical imaging, particularly in positron emission tomography (PET) scanners due to its high energy resolution and fast decay time. Single crystal LYSO offers superior performance, which makes it suitable for high-precision applications in clinical diagnostics. Its efficiency in capturing and converting radiation energy into detectable signals contributes significantly to improved image clarity and accuracy. The demand for this type is growing as healthcare providers increasingly adopt advanced imaging technologies to enhance patient care and diagnostic capabilities. This trend is likely to continue as the German healthcare sector invests in state-of-the-art medical imaging equipment.<p>Another important type in the market is the LYSO polycrystalline material, which offers distinct advantages for certain applications, such as cost-effectiveness and ease of production. While not as efficient as single crystals in terms of performance, polycrystalline LYSO is widely used in less demanding environments, including some industrial applications. It is also a popular choice for research purposes due to its relatively lower cost and flexible material properties.
