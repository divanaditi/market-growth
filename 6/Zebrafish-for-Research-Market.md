One of the key segments is the use of wild-type zebrafish, which are commonly used in genetic, developmental, and environmental research. These fish are ideal for basic biological studies due to their transparent embryos, which allow researchers to observe internal processes in real-time. They serve as an important model organism in toxicology studies, drug discovery, and disease research, especially in the context of human genetics and developmental biology. The prevalence of wild-type zebrafish in laboratories across Germany is expected to continue as the demand for high-quality model organisms grows in pharmaceutical and academic research settings.Another significant type within the market is the genetically modified (GM) zebrafish, which are engineered for specific research applications. These include the creation of transgenic zebrafish that express particular genes or disease markers, enabling detailed studies on gene function, cancer, and neurological disorders. GM zebrafish are particularly valuable for modeling complex human diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, and heart disease.
