Aqueous-based emulsions are widely used due to their superior water solubility, which allows for effective dispersion of zinc pyrithione in formulations. This type of emulsion is preferred in a variety of personal care products, particularly in shampoos, conditioners, and skincare solutions aimed at treating dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and other scalp conditions. The demand for aqueous-based emulsions is driven by their ability to provide a lighter texture, which is ideal for consumers seeking non-greasy solutions. Furthermore, aqueous emulsions are generally cost-effective to produce, enhancing their appeal among manufacturers in Germany's competitive market.On the other hand, oil-based emulsions are gaining traction due to their moisturizing and nourishing properties, making them a popular choice for cosmetic and dermatological formulations. These emulsions provide enhanced stability for zinc pyrithione, improving its effectiveness over time. Oil-based emulsions are commonly incorporated into products designed for dry skin conditions, as they offer longer-lasting hydration compared to their aqueous counterparts. The growth of this segment is fueled by increasing consumer awareness of the benefits of oil-based formulations, especially for sensitive skin and scalp care.
