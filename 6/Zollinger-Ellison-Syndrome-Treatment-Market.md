Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are one of the most widely prescribed treatments in Germany for patients with ZES, as they effectively suppress gastric acid secretion, a core symptom of the disorder. PPIs such as omeprazole and lansoprazole provide relief from symptoms like stomach ulcers and acid reflux by inhibiting the proton pumps in the stomach lining. The demand for PPIs is substantial due to their proven efficacy and safety profiles, making them the first-line treatment option for most patients. Additionally, somatostatin analogs like octreotide are used when PPIs do not adequately control symptoms or when patients exhibit more severe manifestations of ZES, such as refractory ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding.</p><p>Another key treatment approach in the Germany ZES market is surgery, particularly in cases where tumors (gastrinomas) are localized. Surgical removal of the tumors can provide long-term relief and even a potential cure for ZES in some patients. In advanced cases, patients may also undergo chemotherapy or radiation therapy to manage metastatic gastrinomas. The surgery-based treatment segment is witnessing growth as more healthcare providers focus on offering personalized treatment plans tailored to the individual patient's needs. Targeted therapies that inhibit tumor growth and the secretion of excess gastrin are also gaining popularity. These therapies, while still emerging in the market, represent a promising area of innovation aimed at improving outcomes for patients with metastatic or advanced-stage ZES.
