Corrective maintenance refers to the repair or replacement of equipment and systems when they fail or malfunction. This type of service is typically reactive, responding to unplanned breakdowns and ensuring that operations can resume as quickly as possible. Many businesses rely on corrective maintenance due to its immediate nature, although it may result in higher costs if downtime is prolonged.

This approach is cost-effective over the long term as it reduces the likelihood of unexpected breakdowns and extends the lifespan of machinery. Preventive maintenance services in the warehouse sector include routine checks, lubrications, and adjustments to machinery, helping businesses avoid costly downtime and ensuring that operations continue smoothly.
