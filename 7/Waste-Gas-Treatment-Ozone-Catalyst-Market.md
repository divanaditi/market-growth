One major category includes the noble metal catalysts, such as platinum and palladium, which are commonly employed due to their high efficiency in facilitating the ozone reaction. These catalysts offer superior oxidation capabilities, making them ideal for the treatment of industrial waste gases, where complete breakdown of harmful emissions is crucial. Their ability to endure high temperatures and resist poisoning from contaminants further enhances their popularity in demanding applications. As industries in Germany continue to focus on reducing their carbon footprints and meeting stricter environmental regulations, the demand for noble metal-based catalysts is anticipated to grow. Another significant segment in the market consists of transition metal oxide catalysts, which are increasingly being used in ozone treatment processes. These catalysts, which include materials such as manganese oxide, copper oxide, and iron oxide, are known for their cost-effectiveness compared to noble metals. They are also capable of operating at lower temperatures and are less prone to deactivation from environmental impurities. As a result, transition metal oxide catalysts are being widely adopted in applications requiring a more economical solution without compromising on performance. In Germany’s waste gas treatment market, this segment is gaining traction as industries seek ways to balance cost-efficiency with regulatory compliance.
