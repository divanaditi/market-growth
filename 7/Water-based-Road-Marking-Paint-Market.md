One key type is acrylic-based water-based paints, which are widely used for road markings due to their excellent durability and resistance to environmental factors such as weather and UV radiation. These paints provide high visibility and offer a smooth, long-lasting finish that can withstand heavy traffic conditions. Acrylic-based paints are particularly popular for use in urban areas and highways, where performance and durability are essential for maintaining road safety standards. Additionally, they are eco-friendly and comply with increasingly strict environmental regulations in Germany.</p><p>Another notable type in the market is epoxy-based water-based paints.
