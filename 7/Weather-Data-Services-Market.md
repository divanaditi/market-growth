This data is particularly significant for industries concerned with sustainability and compliance with environmental regulations. Lastly, climate data services provide long-term data trends, which are essential for understanding global warming, climate change, and their potential impacts on various sectors, including agriculture, infrastructure, and health.</p><p>Another key segment within the weather data services market is satellite-based weather data, which plays a significant role in weather monitoring.
