These solutions allow businesses to offload the complexity of managing IT systems to cloud providers while ensuring secure browsing environments for their users. As enterprises in Germany embrace digital transformation, cloud-based isolation solutions are increasingly being adopted to protect against cyber threats such as malware, phishing attacks, and data breaches.
