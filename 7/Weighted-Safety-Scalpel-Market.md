Stainless steel blades dominate the market due to their superior durability, resistance to corrosion, and sharpness, making them the preferred choice for precision surgeries. These blades are known for their reliability in both general and specialized surgical procedures, offering excellent performance. Carbon steel blades, on the other hand, are gaining traction for their affordability and ability to maintain sharpness for longer durations. Despite being prone to rust, carbon steel blades are utilized in specific surgical applications where cost-efficiency is prioritized. The demand for each type is influenced by factors such as the intended medical procedure, surgeon preference, and cost considerations in healthcare institutions across Germany.<p>The market also sees segmentation based on handle types, where the weighted and non-weighted variants are popular. Weighted safety scalpels offer enhanced control and precision during surgery, which is why they are increasingly preferred for complex procedures that demand higher accuracy. These scalpels are designed to reduce hand strain by providing better balance and stability, particularly in extended operations. Non-weighted scalpels, while still widely used, are typically favored for lighter, less intricate surgeries.
