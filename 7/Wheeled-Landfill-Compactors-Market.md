These machines are classified into two main categories: single-wheel and multi-wheel compactors. Single-wheel compactors are typically designed for smaller-scale operations, where maneuverability and ease of use are prioritized. They are ideal for compacting waste in more confined areas, providing greater precision in waste placement and compaction. These compactors are widely employed in smaller municipal waste facilities or recycling centers, offering a balance between efficiency and operational cost. Single-wheel models are known for their ability to navigate tighter spaces, which makes them suitable for urban landfill sites with limited room for large equipment.<p>On the other hand, multi-wheel compactors are preferred for large-scale operations where high compaction forces are required for larger volumes of waste.
