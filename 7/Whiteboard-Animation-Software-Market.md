Cloud-based software is gaining significant traction due to its ease of access, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. It allows users to create and share animated videos seamlessly across multiple devices without the need for high-end hardware or technical expertise. This flexibility makes it a popular choice among businesses and educators who prefer a user-friendly and accessible platform. Moreover, cloud-based solutions typically offer subscription-based pricing, which further attracts small and medium-sized enterprises by providing affordable options with regular updates and features. As digital collaboration becomes more essential, cloud-based software continues to dominate the market.<p>On the other hand, on-premise software solutions offer more control and customization for organizations that require greater security and data privacy.
