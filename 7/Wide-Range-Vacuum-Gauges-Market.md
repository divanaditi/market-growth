Among these, the Pirani vacuum gauge is one of the most widely used. It operates by measuring the thermal conductivity of the gas in the vacuum, making it suitable for a broad range of pressure levels. Another key type is the capacitance manometer, known for its precision and accuracy in measuring low pressures. Its application is prevalent in industries such as semiconductor manufacturing and research laboratories. The ionization vacuum gauge is also gaining traction, particularly for ultra-high vacuum environments where other gauges might fall short. These gauges offer excellent performance across diverse industries, including aerospace, chemical, and automotive, where maintaining precise pressure levels is critical for the production and testing of materials and components.<p>Another important segment within the market includes the mechanical vacuum gauges, such as the Bourdon tube gauge and diaphragm gauges. These types are favored for their robustness and simplicity in design. Bourdon tube gauges, for example, are highly reliable in rough vacuum applications, making them ideal for use in industrial settings where high endurance and low maintenance are required. Diaphragm gauges, on the other hand, offer higher accuracy in measuring medium vacuum pressures and are often used in the food processing and pharmaceutical industries.
