They are extensively employed in food packaging, where protection from light, oxygen, and moisture is critical. Coated VMBOPP films are treated with various coatings to enhance properties like printability, heat sealability, and adhesion, making them suitable for advanced applications in both flexible packaging and labeling sectors.</p><p>The growth of the VMBOPP film market in Germany is driven by the increasing demand for high-quality, sustainable packaging solutions. Plain films dominate the market due to their versatility and cost-effectiveness. They are used in food, beverage, and consumer goods packaging, offering benefits such as clarity, printability, and easy conversion.
