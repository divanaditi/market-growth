Standard VR grips are the most commonly used, designed to offer comfort and functionality for a wide range of virtual reality (VR) applications.

They are commonly found with popular VR headsets and controllers, offering users an easy and reliable experience. As VR adoption increases in Germany, demand for these standard grips has seen steady growth, as they cater to both casual and professional users. With a focus on universal compatibility and ergonomic design, standard VR grips remain the dominant segment in the market.<p>On the other hand, custom VR grips have emerged as a growing segment due to the rising demand for personalized experiences. These grips offer enhanced comfort, style, and functionality tailored to the individual user’s preferences. Custom grips are designed to provide ergonomic support for long VR sessions, often incorporating specialized features such as enhanced textures or unique materials that improve grip and reduce hand fatigue. Many gaming enthusiasts, VR developers, and professional users are turning to custom grips to achieve a more immersive experience. This segment is expected to expand as users seek more premium and individualized accessories.
