Among these, plant-based protein supplements are witnessing a rapid growth trend due to the rising popularity of vegetarian and vegan diets. These supplements are sourced from peas, rice, soy, and other plant-based proteins, making them highly sought after by consumers who prefer to avoid animal products. They cater to both athletes and health-conscious individuals looking for protein alternatives to support muscle growth, recovery, and overall wellness. As a result, plant-based protein products continue to dominate the market, with increasing demand from various demographic groups, including fitness enthusiasts and people with dietary restrictions.</p><p>Vitamins and minerals also form a significant segment of the market, with consumers increasingly seeking natural sources of essential nutrients.
