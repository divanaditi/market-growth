Seat belts are one of the most widely used safety systems in vehicles, offering protection to drivers and passengers in the event of sudden deceleration or impact. The demand for advanced seat belt technologies, such as pretensioners and load limiters, is increasing due to growing safety regulations and consumer awareness. Airbags, including front, side, and curtain airbags, are also critical components of the VRS market. These devices deploy in response to a collision, providing a cushion to reduce the impact on occupants. As safety standards in Germany continue to evolve, the market for airbags is expected to expand, with innovations such as knee airbags and pedestrian airbags gaining traction. Child safety seats are another key segment, designed to secure younger passengers and reduce injury risks during accidents.</p><p>In addition to the primary types mentioned, the market also includes newer and more specialized VRS types, such as active headrests and seatbelt technologies integrated with smart sensors. Active headrests are designed to move forward in the event of a rear-end collision, minimizing the risk of whiplash injuries. Smart seatbelt technologies incorporate sensors that monitor occupant status and adjust the restraint force accordingly, offering enhanced protection. The development of these advanced restraint systems reflects the growing trend towards connected and intelligent vehicle safety solutions.
