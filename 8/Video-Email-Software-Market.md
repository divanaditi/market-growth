Cloud-based video email software has seen significant growth due to its flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. As businesses increasingly migrate to cloud platforms, this type of software provides advantages such as remote accessibility, automatic updates, and integration with various cloud tools, making it ideal for organizations seeking efficiency and easy management. The rise of digital communication channels and the need for engaging, personalized content has driven the demand for cloud-based video email solutions, which enable seamless video creation, sharing, and tracking from any location with an internet connection.</p><p>On the other hand, the on-premise segment continues to appeal to organizations with strict data security requirements or those operating in highly regulated industries.
