These devices are often employed for detailed visualization of the nasal cavity and larynx, providing clear, high-definition images for accurate diagnosis and treatment. The rigid type is favored for procedures that require stability and clear visualization, making them popular in both medical diagnostics and surgical interventions. Additionally, rigid video rhino-laryngoscopes are equipped with advanced lighting and high-quality cameras, enhancing their usability in complex clinical environments.On the other hand, flexible video rhino-laryngoscopes are gaining traction in the market due to their versatility and patient comfort. Unlike rigid models, flexible devices can navigate the natural curves of the nasal and throat passages, making them ideal for a wide range of diagnostic procedures. These instruments are particularly advantageous in situations where patient comfort is a priority, such as in outpatient settings. They allow for easier maneuverability and are often employed in routine examinations, as well as for monitoring and diagnosing conditions like nasal polyps, tumors, and other airway obstructions.
