One major type is in-game advertising, where brands place ads within video games to reach a highly engaged audience. This type of advertising leverages immersive experiences to seamlessly integrate ads into game environments, allowing for more organic and impactful interactions. In-game ads are further classified into static ads, dynamic ads, and interactive ads, each serving a specific purpose depending on the game and the intended audience. The growing popularity of esports and mobile gaming in Germany has significantly boosted the demand for in-game advertising, making it one of the most lucrative segments of the market.Another prominent type is augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) advertising. These technologies offer innovative ways for brands to engage with consumers through immersive experiences. AR allows virtual objects or ads to be overlaid onto real-world environments, enhancing user interaction and brand recall. VR, on the other hand, creates entirely virtual worlds for users to explore, with advertisements integrated into these experiences. In Germany, both AR and VR advertising are increasingly being used for experiential marketing campaigns, providing brands with the opportunity to create more memorable and personalized interactions.
