Spectacles are the most commonly used type of vision corrector in the country. They offer a wide range of styles, prescription options, and lens technologies to meet diverse vision correction requirements. With advancements in lens coatings, such as anti-glare and UV protection, spectacles continue to be a popular choice for both nearsighted and farsighted individuals. The growing fashion trend also influences the spectacles market, as eyewear is not just a medical necessity but also an accessory. The convenience, durability, and ease of use make spectacles a leading segment in the German market, despite competition from other vision correction options.<p>On the other hand, contact lenses have gained significant traction in Germany due to their discreet nature and flexibility.
