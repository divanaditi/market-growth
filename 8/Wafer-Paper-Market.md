The simplicity and cost-effectiveness of plain wafer paper make it a staple for bakers and confectioners across the country, contributing to its substantial demand within the German market.<p>On the other hand, printed wafer paper is growing in popularity due to its aesthetic appeal and customization potential. Printed wafer paper is often used for personalized cake decorations, such as custom logos, pictures, and other designs. It is favored by bakeries and event planners for creating eye-catching and unique desserts that cater to specific themes and occasions.
