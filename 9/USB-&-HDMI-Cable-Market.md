As USB Type-C becomes increasingly standardized in newer devices, its popularity is expected to continue rising. Additionally, USB 2.0 cables still maintain a strong presence in legacy systems and affordable consumer gadgets, though their usage is gradually declining. The ongoing demand for faster data exchange and greater compatibility across various devices is driving the growth of advanced USB cable types in the market, which is crucial for meeting the technological needs of modern consumers and businesses alike.</p><p>In contrast, the HDMI cable market in Germany is segmented based on versions and specifications, such as HDMI 1.4, HDMI 2.0, and HDMI 2.1. HDMI 2.0 cables, which offer higher bandwidth and support for 4K resolutions at 60Hz, dominate the current market, especially for entertainment devices like TVs, gaming consoles, and set-top boxes. However, HDMI 2.1, with its support for 8K resolution and higher frame rates, is gaining momentum, particularly in high-end consumer electronics and gaming setups. The rise in demand for 4K and 8K content, coupled with advancements in gaming technology, is driving the adoption of HDMI 2.1 cables. HDMI 1.4 cables are still relevant in specific scenarios, but their usage is decreasing as newer, more powerful standards continue to emerge.
