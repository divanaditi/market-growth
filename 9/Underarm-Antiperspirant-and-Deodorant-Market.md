Antiperspirants are designed to reduce perspiration by blocking the sweat glands, and they are typically favored by consumers seeking long-lasting protection against wetness. These products often contain aluminum-based compounds, which are effective in minimizing sweat production. In Germany, antiperspirants hold a significant share of the market due to growing awareness of personal hygiene and the demand for extended protection. The rise in active lifestyles, including fitness and outdoor activities, has driven the popularity of these products, as individuals seek long-term solutions to control sweat and odor. Furthermore, advancements in antiperspirant formulations, such as sensitive-skin variants and eco-friendly packaging, are contributing to their increased appeal in the market. <p>On the other hand, deodorants are primarily focused on masking body odor without directly affecting sweat production. Deodorants come in various forms, including sprays, roll-ons, sticks, and gels, offering consumers multiple choices for personal care. While deodorants do not prevent sweating, they are commonly used for their refreshing scents and odor-fighting properties. The demand for deodorants in Germany has been driven by a growing emphasis on fragrance and wellness, with an increasing preference for natural and organic ingredients. Consumers are gravitating toward products free from artificial chemicals, parabens, and alcohol, reflecting the broader trend of health-conscious and sustainable consumption. As a result, the deodorant segment is experiencing steady growth, with companies investing in innovative formulations to cater to changing consumer preferences.
