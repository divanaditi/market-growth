Orthotic shoes are designed to provide optimal foot support, improve alignment, and reduce foot pain, making them ideal for individuals with foot disorders such as plantar fasciitis or arthritis. These shoes are engineered with advanced cushioning and arch support to enhance comfort during prolonged use. With an increasing awareness of foot health and the growing prevalence of musculoskeletal conditions, the demand for orthotic shoes is steadily rising. They are widely used by individuals of various age groups, from elderly people to younger adults with active lifestyles. This segment is expected to dominate the market due to its wide applicability in medical conditions that require specialized foot support and comfort.</p><p>On the other hand, diabetic shoes are designed specifically for people with diabetes, focusing on preventing foot injuries and ulcers, which are common complications in diabetic patients.

With the rising prevalence of diabetes in Germany, diabetic shoes are becoming increasingly popular, especially among older adults. This segment of the market is witnessing growth due to the increasing need for footwear that addresses specific health concerns, helping diabetic individuals maintain mobility and comfort without compromising on foot care.
