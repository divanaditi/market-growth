External devices primarily consist of products such as penile clamps and urinary collection devices, which are designed to offer comfort and convenience to individuals experiencing urinary incontinence. These devices are typically non-invasive and easy to use, making them a popular choice for mild to moderate cases. Absorbent products, such as adult diapers and pads, are another key segment, catering to both men and women with varying degrees of incontinence. These products are widely used due to their affordability, ease of use, and discreetness, addressing the needs of individuals who require continuous protection from leakage. The growing demand for discreet, high-quality absorbent products is driven by an increasing awareness of incontinence management options across the country.</p><p>Implanted devices, such as artificial urinary sphincters and sacral nerve stimulators, represent a more advanced category within the market. These devices are typically used for severe cases of urinary incontinence and offer longer-term solutions for patients who have not found sufficient relief through external or absorbent products. Implanted devices have been gaining popularity due to their effectiveness in providing a more permanent solution to incontinence. With advances in medical technology, these devices are becoming more refined and are being increasingly utilized in clinical settings.
