One of the prominent types includes the single-chamber system, which effectively separates urine from solid waste. This system is primarily designed for eco-conscious users looking to reduce water consumption and minimize environmental impact. Its simple and cost-effective design makes it a popular choice for small homes, rural areas, and off-grid locations. The single-chamber systems are also being adopted in public facilities to enhance sustainability efforts and reduce the burden on municipal wastewater systems. This type of toilet has seen growth due to increasing awareness of water scarcity and the need for waste management solutions that offer long-term benefits.<p>On the other hand, multi-chamber systems have gained traction due to their advanced capabilities in waste segregation.
