Truck-mounted vacuum sweepers dominate the market due to their large capacity and efficiency in cleaning extensive road networks. These sweepers are designed for high performance, capable of handling large volumes of debris while ensuring effective dust control. As urbanization grows and road maintenance requirements increase, truck-mounted sweepers have become essential for municipalities and contractors looking for long-term, cost-effective solutions to keep streets clean and safe. They are especially popular for cleaning highways, city streets, and other major urban areas that require regular maintenance.<p>In addition to truck-mounted sweepers, ride-on vacuum sweepers are also gaining traction in the Germany market. These machines are suitable for medium to large-scale cleaning tasks, offering flexibility and enhanced maneuverability. Ride-on sweepers are widely used in municipal and commercial applications, providing operators with comfort and ease of control. Meanwhile, walk-behind vacuum sweepers, although less prevalent than the other types, continue to be used in small-scale environments such as parking lots, sidewalks, and other confined spaces.
