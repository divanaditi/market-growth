Often marketed with vibrant colors, graphics, or personalized engravings, these bottles appeal to both young adults and professionals seeking functional yet stylish hydration solutions. The customization trend has accelerated in recent years, with consumers looking for products that reflect their individual tastes. Additionally, such bottles are frequently used in promotional campaigns and corporate giveaways, further boosting their market penetration.
