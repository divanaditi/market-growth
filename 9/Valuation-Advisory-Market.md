This segment is driven by the country's dynamic real estate market, which requires precise valuation for buying, selling, and financing decisions. Moreover, fluctuations in property prices, regulatory changes, and increasing demand for real estate investments further stimulate the need for expert advisory services. Business valuation, on the other hand, caters to companies seeking to determine their worth for mergers and acquisitions, financial reporting, tax assessments, and succession planning. This segment is growing rapidly, as more businesses engage in corporate restructuring and investors look for comprehensive valuations to assess opportunities in the market.</p><p>The other notable segment in the German Valuation Advisory market is intangible asset valuation, which has gained traction in recent years.

Additionally, machinery and equipment valuation is another important area, where advisory services are required to assess the market value of specialized equipment in sectors such as manufacturing, construction, and energy. These valuations help businesses in financial reporting, insurance coverage, and investment planning.
