Vitamins and minerals play a key role in ensuring that children receive essential nutrients that might be missing from plant-based diets. Vitamin D, B12, and calcium supplements are in high demand, as these are commonly lacking in vegan children's nutrition. Omega-3 supplements derived from algae are gaining popularity due to their benefits for brain development and overall cognitive health. Protein supplements, often derived from peas, rice, or hemp, are another important category in the market, helping to meet the protein requirements of growing children who follow plant-based diets. These supplements provide an easy way for parents to ensure their children receive balanced nutrition without compromising on ethical and environmental concerns associated with animal-derived products.</p><p>Another significant type in the market includes probiotics and digestive health supplements, which are essential for supporting gut health and immunity in children.
